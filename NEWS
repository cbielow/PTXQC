      this allows to compare samples, but also hints at overlooked variable modifications)

v0.81.0 -- 2016/10/18
  -  [METRIC] new experimental MS/MS intensity metric 
     (scoring the MS/MS TIC vs. base peak, to look for bad ion transmission or fragmentation)

  - minor doc improvments (Metric help texts in Html report)

v0.80.2 -- 2016/04/04
  - reduce memory footprint (~50% reduction; replacing ddply() with data.table[])

v0.80.1 -- 2016/03/15
  - experimental missing value metric (on peptide level)
    - density plots (showing what intensities are usually missing)
