  -  fixes to new Dependent Peptides (DP) plot (issue #28) (added target sites in percent)

v0.82.0 -- 2016/11/01
  -  [METRIC] new Dependent Peptides (DP) plot (issue #28)
     (if DP were enabled in MaxQuant, the Top5 modifications will be displayed;
      this allows to compare samples, but also hints at overlooked variable modifications)

v0.81.0 -- 2016/10/18
  -  [METRIC] new experimental MS/MS intensity metric 
     (scoring the MS/MS TIC vs. base peak, to look for bad ion transmission or fragmentation)

[CRAN] v0.80.14 -- 2016/10/13 
  -  CRAN test fix (make PANDOC optional -- prevents Html reports and Vignettes)

[CRAN] v0.80.13 -- 2016/10/07
  -  minor documentation changes prior to CRAN submission
  
v0.80.12 -- 2016/09/28

  -  bug fixes
      - augment fix from v0.80.9 since MaxQuant for finding a MBR reference Raw file

      https://github.com/cbielow/PTXQC/issues/21
  - Html report will be created prior to PDF file (if both are requested [default])
  - minor doc improvments (Metric help texts in Html report)

v0.80.2 -- 2016/04/04
  - reduce memory footprint (~50% reduction; replacing ddply() with data.table[])

v0.80.1 -- 2016/03/15
  - experimental missing value metric (on peptide level)
    - density plots (showing what intensities are usually missing)
      - includes simple inter-Raw file normalization scheme
    - percentage of missing values (lower is better) -- used for scoring in heatmap
