# Input/Output data for PTXQC

PTXQC generates quality control reports for [MaxQuant] results.

## Input

When a full report is generated, PTXQC requires the following **input files**:
  
  - parameters.txt
  - summary.txt
  - proteinGroups.txt
  - evidence.txt
  - msms.txt
  - msmsScans.txt

These files can be found in the `<baseDir>/combined/txt` folder after MaxQuant analysis successfully finished.
Here, `<baseDir>` is your main MaxQuant project folder containing your Raw files.

If you are not interested in the full report or only a subset of these files are available,
PTXQC can be configured to look only at some of them. See the [PTX-CustomizeReport] [Ref_VignCust] vignette
```{r, eval=FALSE}
vignette("PTXQC-CustomizeReport", package = "PTXQC")
```
for details.

## Output

By default, PTXQC will generate a report in **PDF** format.

We are currently adding support for a more interactive **HTML** report. To enable HTML output,
just set it in the YAML config file (see above for the vignette hint on report customization).

Further output files (with the same prefix name as the PDF report), include

  - `report_vXXX_heatmap.txt` (values of the overview heatmap)
  - `report_vXXX_filename_sort.txt` (customize the order and naming of Raw files in the report)
  - `report_v0.69.1.yaml` (the configuration file)
  
The YAML configuration file is created the first time you run PTXQC on a txt-folder. Customize it as you see fit.

Read more about `report_vXXX_filename_sort.txt` and `report_v0.69.1.yaml` in the [PTX-CustomizeReport] [Ref_VignCust] vignette.
