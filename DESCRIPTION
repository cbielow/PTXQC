Description: Generates Proteomics (PTX) quality control (QC) reports for shotgun LC-MS data analyzed with the 
             MaxQuant software suite (from .txt files) or mzTab files (ideally from OpenMS 'QualityControl' tool).
             Reports are customizable (target thresholds, subsetting) and available in HTML or PDF format.
