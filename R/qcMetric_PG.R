the group-wise summed protein abundance. This allows to delineate a high contamination in high complexity samples from a high 
contamination in low complexity samples (e.g. from in-gel digestion). If you see only one 
abundance class ('mid'), this means all your groups have roughly
the same summed protein intensity.
